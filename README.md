# EduAgent+ — AI Multi-Agent Study Coach for Personalized Learning

PROBLEM STATEMENT

Why Multi-Agent AI?

Multi-agent systems allow separation of responsibilities:

	•	Agents collaborate to provide a cohesive and adaptive learning experience.
	•	Flexibility to add or replace agents as the system grows.
